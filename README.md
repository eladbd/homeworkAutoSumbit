Hello,

This is Auto submit tool for Azrieli college.

I tried to make the GUI user friendly as possible still have a lot of work to be done :).

MainWindow.py contains the whole class of the GUI and seleniumScript.py contains the script that runs selenium on the college website and submit the assignment.

CreateCred.py and CredReader.py are not my work i took it from GFG and adjusted it for my work as i want passwords to be save on the user computer with base security so no one can actually read the password from the file without the right key.

So as you can see this is the current GUI window.

If the user want to keep hes username and password for next assignments he just need to click on the 'Save for later' checkBox.
**once the checkBox isnt clicked the username and password file will be deleted.
